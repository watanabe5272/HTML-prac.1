# HTML-prac.1
HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that are made in studying and practicing are put.

This work of mine is consisted of the 2 HTML pages.
"intro.html" is the home page.  And you can move to the second page by pushing the grape-shaped button at the bottom of "intro.html".

The contents in the page (texts and photos) has been changed a bit from what was originally used.

My particular and favorite points are
1. The home page "intro.html" is an enjoyable section.
 - 1.1. Colorful circles in the background flee when the mouse cursor touches them.
 - 1.2. Grape-shaped button is very cute that can be pressed to move to the second page.
 - 1.3. The other grape at the upper left of the page is provided to turn music on and off.

2. The second page is an letter section.
 - 2.1. The texture of the letter is warm frosted glass.
 - 2.2. There is noise texture on the background. Please check it carefully.
 - 2.3. A photo of our memories is placed at the lower right of the letter.
