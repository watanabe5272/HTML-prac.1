# HTML-prac.1
HTML/CSSJavaScript files that are made in studying and practicing are put.

This work of mine is consisted of the 2 HTML pages.
"intro.html" is the home page.  And you can move to the second page by pushing the grape-shaped button at the bottom of "intro.html".

The contents in the page (texts and photos) has been changed using ChatGPT, from what was originally used.

My particular and favorite points are
1. The home page "intro.html" is an enjoyable section.
 - 1.1. Colorful circles in the background flee when the mouse cursor touches them.
 - 1.2. Grape-shaped button is very cute that can be pressed to move to the scond page.
 - 1.3. The other grape at the upper left of the page is provided to turn music on and off.

2. The second page is an letter section.
 - 2.1. Warm frosted glass is the texture of the letter.
 - 2.2. There is noise texture on the background. If you look closely, you will notice it.
 - 2.3. A photo of our memories is placed at the lower right of the letter.
